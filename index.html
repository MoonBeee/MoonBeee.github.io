          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p class="lead">Born and raised in Halifax, I was ever curious. Fascinated by computers and technology I started
            creating websites at the age of ten. After 15 years of working in the restaurant industry
            I had learned a lot about teamwork and culinary, but I needed a change. I returned to school at NSCC in 2017
            and started my programming journey.
            </p>
          <p class="lead">Through my education I have had the pleasure of working on a few projects. I was part of
            Project Blackbird as a member of the development team. During Project Blackbird we created a web application
            to track students progression in their self directed studies.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">For my NSCC Capstone Project I was part of team that developed a web application for the Halifax Higher
            Education Partnership. We created an application that will centralize information about events, programs,
            articulation programs, organizations, and available facilities that are offered by NSCC, Dalhousie, St. Mary's
            and other local post-secondary institutions.

          <h2>Skill Set</h2>
          <p class="lead">I have an affinity for Python, JavaScript, C++, web development and machine learning.
            Though through my NSCC education I have used many languages/frameworks such as:</p>

           </div>
          <p class="lead">Applications that are simple and intuitive
            make tasks easier for a broader range of humans, which is a goal I believe benefits everyone.</p>

                <p class="lead">For this console based application I was tasked to create a simulation. The 'H's represent humans and the 'Z's
                  represent zombies. The humans move in a 4-directional pattern and replicate if they survive a predetermined number of turns. The
                  zombies move in an 8-directional pattern and consume humans in their vicinty, after a predetermined number of turn they convert a
                  human in an adjacent cell into a zombie.</p>
                <p class="lead">This application was a focus on object oriented programming. Both human and zombies are a sub-class of 'organism'.
                  Every turn the organisms "move" function was called as the application iterated over the 2-dimensional plane showcasing the power
                  of polymorphism. As this was built in C++ this was also a create learning expirience of how pointers and the garabage collector work.</p>
                <p class="lead">This was one of my favourite applications I have built to date. I learned a lot about pointers and C++ operator overloading as well as
                  furthering my knowledge of OOP.</p>

              to create new notes, save notes, update notes, searc through existing notes, display notes, and delete them.</p>

                working with CRUD operations of a Windows App, and asynchronous functions. Through this project I learned a lot about the
