          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p class="lead">Born and raised in Halifax, I was ever curious. Fascinated by computers and technology I started
            creating websites at the age of ten. After 15 years of working in the restaurant industry
            I had learned a lot about teamwork and culinary, but I needed a change. I returned to school at NSCC in 2017
            and started my programming journey.
            </p>
          <p class="lead">Through my education I have had the pleasure of working on a few projects. I was part of
            Project Blackbird as a member of the development team. During Project Blackbird we created a web application
            to track students progression in their self directed studies.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">For my NSCC Capstone Project I was part of team that developed a web application for the Halifax Higher
            Education Partnership. We created an application that will centralize information about events, programs,
            articulation programs, organizations, and available facilities that are offered by NSCC, Dalhousie, St. Mary's
            and other local post-secondary institutions.

                <p class="lead">For this console based application I was tasked to create a simulation. The 'H's represent humans and the 'Z's
                  represent zombies. The humans move in a 4-directional pattern and replicate if they survive a predetermined number of turns. The
                  zombies move in an 8-directional pattern and consume humans in their vicinty, after a predetermined number of turn they convert a
                  human in an adjacent cell into a zombie.</p>
                <p class="lead">This application was a focus on object oriented programming. Both human and zombies are a sub-class of 'organism'.
                  Every turn the organisms "move" function was called as the application iterated over the 2-dimensional plane showcasing the power
                  of polymorphism. As this was built in C++ this was also a create learning expirience of how pointers and the garabage collector work.</p>
                <p class="lead">This was one of my favourite applications I have built to date. I learned a lot about pointers and C++ operator overloading as well as
                  furthering my knowledge of OOP.</p>

                <p class="lead">As the name implies there was a create emphasis on overloading operators. We created a class that would represent a fraction. The user
                  was prompted to enter in 2 fractions and then the 2 numbers would go through a sequence of operations. This showcased that despite that the fractions were objects
                  they could be added, divided, multiplied, subtracted and also evaluated as equal or greater/less than.

          <h1>Moving Forward</h1>
          <!--Goals stuff here -->
          <p class="lead">Two years ago I started on my journey of becoming a programmer with no previous skills in the field, and no real idea what exactly
            what I was getting into. I had made a few very simple webpages with plain html but that had been 20 years prior. Returning to school, and learning
             to program was easily one of my best decisions that I have ever made. I thoroughly enjoy solving problems and coding.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            I have learned a lot from NSCC but it is just the start. NSCC gave me a solid foundation to build my career on. I learned a lot about a broad set of categories
            from basic logic for problem solving to computer networking to social networking. The course was short but allowed me to touch a lot of different technology.
            There is still so much to learn but I feel well prepared to take on any language or problem that is placed before me.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Moving forward with my career I plan to continue to learn and develop as programmer and work as a member of a team. I would like to take my previous
            leadership skills from my years in the kitchen and become a project manager.
